    <h1> <strong>JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY</strong> </h1>
    <p>When ambition
        meets opportunity,
        anything
        is possible.
        At Johns Hopkins, you can explore ideas that interest you, find people who inspire and challenge you, and make
        discoveries that change your life—and the world.</p>
    <h2>HOPKINS IN THE COMMUNITY</h2>
    <P>With our main campuses located in Baltimore, Johns Hopkins is truly and proudly a city resident. Our commitment
        to our local communities is based on the simple truth that the health and well-being of the university is
        inextricably tied to the physical, social, and economic well-being of the city in which we live. Our founder and
        namesake, Johns Hopkins, put forth that idea when he made a bequest to establish a university and a hospital.

        As the city’s largest anchor institution, Johns Hopkins feels the constant pull of urban issues. Our faculty,
        staff, students, and administrators answer the call on a daily basis, in ways both large and small, from
        volunteering as tutors in local schools to contributing nearly $5 billion in economic output in the city.

    </P>
    <br>
    <p>
       <b> <i><font color"blue">Johns Hopkins is profoundly committed to the well-being and flourishing of Baltimore, its communities, and our
        neighbors, and we believe our success is inseparable from that of the city we are proud to call home.</font></i></b> </p>
